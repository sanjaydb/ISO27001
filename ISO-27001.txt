What is Risk Assessment
-----------------------
{
  organization should recognize all the potential problems with their information, how likely they are to occur and what the 
  consequences might be. The purpose of risk assessment is to find out which controls are needed in order to decrease the risk – 
  selection of controls is called the risk treatment process, and in ISO 27001 they are chosen from Annex A which specifies 114 
  controls.

Threats
-------
{
  This list of threats and vulnerabilities can serve as a help for implementing risk assessment within the framework of ISO 27001 or ISO 
  22301. E.G.
  Below is a list of threats – this is not a definitive list, it must be adapted to the individual organization:
  --------------------------
  {

The Statement of Applicability Is A Crucial Component of An ISO 27001 Risk Assessment
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{
  According to ISO/IEC 27001:2013, organizations performing a ISO 27001 Risk Assessment must produce a Statement of Accountability that 
  
  includes the following:
  -----------------------
  .A listing of established security controls, based on specific operations, that serve to safely manage collected, stored and 
   transmitted customer data.
  .Justifications for including controls.
  .Whether the controls have been implemented or not.
  .Justifications as to why any of the ISO 27001 Annex A controls were excluded.

}


Annex A
-------
{
    Annex A,have 133 security controls, they also cover physical security, legal protection, human resources management, organizational 
    issues, etc. Therefore, you could consider Annex A as a form of a catalog of security measures to be used during your treatment 
    process - once you identify unacceptable risks in risk assessment, Annex A will help you choose the right control(s) to decrease 
    those risks. And ensure you don't forget any important control.
    
    in some of the controls, Annex A mentions policies and procedures, however it does not require those to be documented. It might seem 
    funny, but only where the word "documented" appears, does the standard require written policies/procedures.
    
    it mentions the word "documented" in only 6 controls (A.5.1.1, A.7.1.3, A.8.1.1, A.10.1.1, A.11.1.1, A.15.1.1) - that means you can 
    implement all the other controls without documenting them
    
    The main part of the standard, or more precisely the mandatory clauses 4 to 8 contain the management part of the standard - they
    prescribe the PDCA cycle (Plan-Do-Check-Act phases), including risk assessment and treatment, documentation control, records
    control, provision of resources, internal audit, management review, corrective and preventive actions, etc.
        
    Annex A contains the following clauses (sometimes called ISO 27001 Annex A domains):

    A.5 Security policy
    A.6 Organization of information security
    A.7 Asset management
    A.8 Human resources security
    A.9 Physical and environmental security
    A.10 Communications and operations management
    A.11 Access control
    A.12 Information systems acquisition, development and maintenance
    A.13 Information security incident management
    A.14 Business continuity management
    A.15 Compliance
