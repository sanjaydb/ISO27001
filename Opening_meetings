{
	This is stage-1 audit and What to expect from Stage 1 and Stage 2 ISO 27001 audits
	
	Stage-1 Audit will help you to see whether your ISMS (information security management system) is likely to meet all the necessary criteria.
	Considering this a pre-certification i.e. ‘dress rehearsal’ audit. It allows you to identify any potential problems that can be ironed out 
	before the actual audit i.e. Stage-2, and it gives your staff the opportunity to see how the big day will play out. 
	Don't get offended if you get NC its good to know our GAPS here, before the certification audit i.e. Stage-2.
	If you get NC you need to close it specfic period of time.
	Major NC with in 30 days 
	Minor NC with in 60 days of time.  
	
	

	Stage 1 audit
The Stage 1 audit is often called a ‘documentation review’ audit, because the auditor will review your processes and policies to establish whether
they’re in line with the requirements of ISO 27001.

This stage is more of a ‘reconnaissance’ audit, or a ‘pre-assessment’, where the auditor does a high-level review of your ISMS and establishes whether
the internal audit programme is in place.

Stage 1 is completed on-site to determine whether your ISMS has met the minimum requirements of the Standard and is ready for a certification audit.
The auditor will point out any areas of nonconformity and potential improvements of the management system.
